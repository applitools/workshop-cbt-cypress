# Workshop Walkthrough

This guide provides a full written walkthrough for the
[Modern Cross-Browser Testing with Cypress](http://applitools.info/66v) workshop
led by [Pandy Knight](https://twitter.com/AutomationPanda)
and hosted by [Applitools](https://applitools.com/).
You can code along with the video recordings,
or you can reference it afterwards to help you learn more.


## 1. Traditional cross-browser testing

Traditional cross-browser testing requires lots of work,
both in automating test cases and in maintaining testing infrastructure.
Let's give this a try ourselves to see what it takes.


### 1.1. Writing a typical login test

Web UI testing is all about app behaviors:
interacting with visual interfaces and verifying outcomes.
Let's automate a simple website login test to use for cross-browser testing.
We will use the [Applitools demo site](https://demo.applitools.com):
`https://demo.applitools.com`.
This site has a twist, though:
it has a [second version](https://demo.applitools.com/index_v2.html)
with visual differences at `https://demo.applitools.com/index_v2.html`.

The test steps are straightforward:

```gherkin
Scenario: Successful login
  Given the login page is displayed
  When the user enters their username and password
  And the user clicks the login button
  Then the main page is displayed
```

The login page looks like this:

![Demo site login page](images/demo-site-login.png)

And the main page looks like this:

![Demo site main page](images/demo-site-main.png)

We can automate this test in many ways,
but for this workshop,
we will build a [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) project written in JavaScript.
This repository is structured like a typical Cypress project.
[`cypress/integration/traditional.spec.js`](cypress/integration/traditional.spec.js)
is an automated implementation of this login test:

```javascript
describe('A traditional test', () => {

    beforeEach(() => {
        cy.viewport(1600, 1200)
    })

    it('should log into the demo app', () => {
        loadLoginPage()
        verifyLoginPage()
        performLogin()
        verifyMainPage()
    })
})
```

Cypress uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as its core test framework.
In Mocha, tests are grouped together in `describe` calls.
The `beforeEach` call sets the browser viewport for Cypress for each test in the group.
Each test is defined using an `it` call.
Here, there is one group ("A traditional test") containing one test ("should log into the demo app").
Each step in the login test is implemented as a helper method.

Loading the login page looks like this:

```javascript
function loadLoginPage() {
    let site = Cypress.env('DEMO_SITE') ?? 'original'
    let extra = (site == 'original') ? '' : '/index_v2.html'
    cy.visit('https://demo.applitools.com' + extra)
}
```

The `loadLoginPage` function uses a Cypress environment variable named `DEMO_SITE`
to specify if the test should run against the original site or the changed site.

Once the login page is loaded, the test verifies that certain things appear:

```javascript
function verifyLoginPage() {
    cy.get('div.logo-w').should('be.visible')
    cy.get('#username').should('be.visible')
    cy.get('#password').should('be.visible')
    cy.get('#log-in').should('be.visible')
    cy.get('input.form-check-input').should('be.visible')
}
```

These assertions explicitly wait for a specific set of elements to appear.
They check purely for appearance â€“ not for any shape, size, or look.

Performing login requires a few WebDriver interactions:

```javascript
function performLogin() {
    cy.get('#username').type('andy')
    cy.get('#password').type('i<3pandas')
    cy.get('#log-in').click()
}
```

Once login is complete, the main page appears.
Unfortunately, there's almost too much on the main page to check!
The test picks a few important things and makes several assertions:

```javascript
function verifyMainPage() {

    // Check various page elements
    cy.get('div.logo-w').should('be.visible')
    cy.get('div.element-search.autosuggest-search-activator > input').should('be.visible')
    cy.get('div.avatar-w img').should('be.visible')
    cy.get('ul.main-menu').should('be.visible')
    cy.contains('Add Account').should('be.visible')
    cy.contains('Make Payment').should('be.visible')
    cy.contains('View Statement').should('be.visible')
    cy.contains('Request Increase').should('be.visible')
    cy.contains('Pay Now').should('be.visible')

    // Check time message
    cy.get('#time').invoke('text').should('match', /Your nearest branch closes in:( \d+[hms])+/)

    // Check menu element names
    cy.get('ul.main-menu li span').should(items => {
        expect(items[0]).to.contain.text('Card types')
        expect(items[1]).to.contain.text('Credit cards')
        expect(items[2]).to.contain.text('Debit cards')
        expect(items[3]).to.contain.text('Lending')
        expect(items[4]).to.contain.text('Loans')
        expect(items[5]).to.contain.text('Mortgages')
    })

    // Check transaction statuses
    const statuses = ['Complete', 'Pending', 'Declined']
    cy.get('span.status-pill + span').each(($span, index) => {
        expect(statuses).to.include($span.text())
    })
}
```

Wow, that's a little overwhelming.
Some assertions just check that elements appear.
Others check aspects of elements, like text values.
Nevertheless, the element locators and the code for performing these assertions are a bit complex.
They also do *not* cover everything on the page.
There's risk that unchecked things could break.


### 1.2. Running the test locally

Let's run this test locally.
To manually launch tests, execute `npx cypress open` from the command line
and then run the target tests from the Cypress browser window that opens.
This repository also has npm scripts for testing declared in `package.json`.
You can run `npm run cypress` to open the Cypress window
or `npm test` to run tests purely from the command line.
The test should take no more than a minute to complete, and it should pass.

Unfortunately, this test overlooks visual things.
Take a look at the "changed" version of the demo site:

![Demo site login page changed](images/demo-site-login-changed.png)

Can you spot the subtle differences?

* The icon at the top is broken
* The "Sign in" button now says "Log in"
* This button changed from blue to black

Traditional test automation struggles to detect differences like these.
We could try to add more assertions to our test,
but they'd probably be complicated and fragile.
For now, let's take a risk and ignore them.
(We will revisit ways to handle them better later in this workshop.)

If we want to run this test against either version of the login page,
we could update the `loadLoginPage` method like this:

Try rerunning the test with the changed demo site.
You can execute `npm run cypress:original` and `npm run cypress:changed`
to specify the site version via the `DEMO_SITE` variable.
Even when `DEMO_SITE=changed`, the test will still pass.
